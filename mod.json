  "description": "Adds multiple new factories, turrets and items to enhance vanilla content and add more things post-late game. IMPORTANT: Most of the sprites here (especially the turrets) have been stolen from other creators without their permission. I do not have any right over theses sprites, and absolutely do not claim that i have created them or owned them. I have modified them, changed palette, or added new elements. Here are a few of the creators of the sprites i used: Anuke Himslef (I'm terribly sorry), Eschatologue/Unlimited-Armament-Works, AureusStratus/ExoGenesis, Terios-mods'color palette), Eschatologue/Heavy-Armaments-Industries, uujuju1/project-oblivion",
