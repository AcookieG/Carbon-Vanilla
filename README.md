# Carbon-Vanilla
A Mindustry mod made by myself, adding new content for vanilla, but also a whole new planet and its tech tree.
# Important:
some sprites are stolen content from other mods, that'swhy it took me so long to update.
V8.0 only (currently migrating), I only coded in that version, any backwards compatibility will be futile.
## I need new sprites for this mod, and I have no clue how to make them, so if anyone wants to make any, please contact me
If you are the creator of one of those sprites and don't want them to be used here, just notify me and I will comply.
